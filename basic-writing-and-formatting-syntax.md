Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been commited.  

Pressing `Ctrl-E` inserts the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.  

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

(I formatted the code into its own distinct block using opening and closing triple backticks.)  

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.  
|Color|Syntax|Example|
|:---:|:----:|:-----:|
| HEX: | `#RRGGBB` | `#0969DA` |  
| RGB: | `rgb(R,G,B)` | `rgb(9, 105, 218)` |  
| HSL: | `hsl(H,S,L)` | `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)` |  

+ A supported color model cannot have any leading or trailing spaces within the backticks.
+ The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
